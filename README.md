## Mars Mod SPRINT

  - Are you tired of pressing the Sprint key again everytime you start moving?
  - Would you like to sprint in any direction, even backwards?
  - Do you want to keep sprinting even when using skills?

# How To Use

  - Press "Left Alt" and "Sprint" together to Activate/Deactivate Mars Mod Sprint.
  - While activated, hold "Sprint" to walk. While deactivated, "Sprint" behaves normally.
  - Default behavior is Activated. Change the "AutoActivate" setting in the mod config to "false" to disable this feature.
    - You can find the config after running the mod once in the /Risk of Rain 2/BepInEx/config/ folder named com.marsupilami.marsmodsprint.cfg

### Installation

  - [Install BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/)
  - Extract the MarsMod folder into the /Risk of Rain 2/BepInEx/plugins/ folder.

### Issues

  - Off-Host stability not guaranteed. Some skills may not cancel sprint properly and auto sprint may stop working when affected by certain enemy debuffs.
  - "Mage" Ice Wall skill can be glitchy especially with extra charges.
  - Report additional issues here: [https://github.com/Marsupilami75/MarsModSprint/issues](https://github.com/Marsupilami75/MarsModSprint/issues)

  - Better compatibility for the "Mage" Ice Wall skill.
  - Better Off-Host compatibility.
